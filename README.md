# Happy Farmers Family
## Introduction
###### Farmers in India face a variety of issues, and we offer comprehensive solutions to some of these issues. In that, we primarily concentrate on the issues related to improperinformation and guidance regarding market rates, agricultural cultivation, and weather updates and government schemes. Farmers may access live market rates, weather updates, and appropriate crop cultivation assistance using this app. The government schemes module serves as a one-stop resource, ensuring that farmers are aware of the available government support and can easily navigate through the scheme options

### Introduction to Project
###### We intend to develop a smartphone app that will help farmers solve issues including a lack of precise market rate information, a lack of appropriate crop production recommendations, and a lack of awareness of the many government schemes for farmers. 
###### Today farmers are dealing with a number of problems, one of which is the lack of information regarding market prices for any given crop. As a result, farmers are easily duped by brokers and intermediaries, such as transporters, who cheat them by failing to disclose actual market prices. Because there is no platform or other available method for farmers to learn the actual prices, this makes the Indian economy vulnerable to scams. As a result, we thought to create a module for our app that will provide actual market rate information for every crop from the APMC in order to address this issue. 
###### We planned to create an application where farmers can access up-to-date market rates, information about crop cultivation, weather updates, and blogs about government schemes that are useful to farmers and encourage them to take use of those schemes.

### Problem Statement
###### Farmers now confront a range of difficulties, such as a lack of information about crop production, a lack of access to the most recent crop market prices, and a lack of awareness of the numerous government schemes available to them.Hence there is need to have a single platform for farmers to access accurate current markets rates, basic crop cultivation information and weather updates and provide proper solution to mentioned issues

### Unique Features of the App
- Weather is one of the major parts in the agricultural sector. The mobile app provides farmers with real-time weather updates tailored to their specific location. By leveraging an API from OpenWeatherAPI, the app retrieves accurate and upto-date weather information in the form of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. This includes temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and other relevant meteorological data.Additionally, the app incorporates a predictive feature that offers weather forecasts for the next three days. This feature enables farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and other crucial farming practices.

- The app offers a comprehensive database of crop information covering a wide range of crops. Farmers can access detailed guidelines and best practices for each crop, including cultivation techniques, optimal planting times, recommended fertilizers, disease management strategies, pest control methods, and post-harvest handling instructions. The information provided is tailored to the specific needs of each crop, empowering farmers with the knowledge and guidance necessary to maximize their crop yields, minimize losses, and enhance overall productivity

- Another feature is the app facilitates direct communication between farmers and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) authorities. APMC, in collaboration with the government, updates the market rates in real-time through API. The updated data which is form of JSON structure, is then collected and utilized in app. This ensures that farmers have access to the most current and accurate market prices for their produce.

- Furthermore, the app includes a feature that allows authorized APMC personnel to directly update market rates within the app. This functionality ensures transparency and eliminates intermediaries, enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding the sale of their crops and negotiate fair prices. Recognizing the importance of government schemes in supporting agricultural development, the app incorporates a dedicated module that provides comprehensive details about various government schemes. Farmers can access information on eligibility criteria, application procedures, required documentation, and associated benefits. 
- The module serves as a one-stop resource, ensuring that farmers are aware of the available government support and can easily navigate through the scheme options. By facilitating access to government schemes, the app empowers farmers to avail themselves of financial assistance, subsidies, insurance coverage, and other forms of support, ultimately promoting sustainable agricultural practices and facilitating their overall growth and success.

- To cater to a wider user base, the app is available in both Marathi and English languages. This ensures that farmers across different regions and linguistic backgrounds can benefit from its features and functionalities. By providing localized content in Marathi, the app enhances accessibility and usability, allowing farmers to navigate through the app and access information more effectively. The availability of multiple language options reflects the apps commitment to inclusivity.
